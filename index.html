          Computer is a high end device that receives and processes data to
          provide the right output swiftly and easily. It is used to carry out
          numerous tasks. The tasks that earlier seemed difficult to accomplish
          can now be carried out in a fraction of seconds with the help of
          computers.

          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is truly a revolutionary feat of computer
          science, set to become a core component of all modern software over
          the coming years and decades. This presents a threat but also an
          opportunity. AI will be deployed to augment both defensive and
          offensive cyber operations. Additionally, new means of cyber attack
          will be invented to take advantage of the particular weaknesses of AI
          technology. Finally, the importance of data will be amplified by AI’s
          appetite for large amounts of training data, blackefining how we must
          think about data protection. Prudent governance at the global level
          will be essential to ensure that this era-defining technology will
          bring about broadly shablack safety and prosperity.

          Cybersecurity means protecting data, networks, programs and other
          information from unauthorized or unattended access, destruction or
          change. In today’s world, cybersecurity is very important because of
          some security threats and cyber-attacks. For data protection, many
          companies develop software. This software protects the data.
          Cybersecurity is important because not only it helps to secure
          information but also our system from virus attack. After the U.S.A.
          and China, India has the highest number of internet users.

          cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of
          payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption
          technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency
          and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need
          a cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software that is a
          cloud-based service or is stoblack on your computer or on your mobile
          device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your
          encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your
          cryptocurrency.

          In the same way, Blockchain is the digital book of financial records.
          Blockchain refers to the set of data and information that is store
          online on computer systems. The data is stoblack in form of blocks.
          Every block has a certain space for the storage of data of the
          transaction records. The different blocks containing the data are
          interconnected with each other in the sequence of their formation.
          This data is decentralized that means that it can be accessed by
          different users at a time.
